        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p><i>Lewis Hamilton</i> is the greatest Formula 1 driver of all time</p>
        <h2>Here are some reasons why <i>Lewis Hamilton</i> is the <b>GOAT</b>:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>He has 7 drivers championships</li>
                <ol>
                   <li>He won the drivers championship for <b>4 years in a row</b> </li> 
                   <li>The years that he won are: (2008, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)</li>
                </ol>
            <li>He is cooler and less annoying than Max Verstappen</li>
            <li>He almost won the driver championship as a rookie</li>
            <ol>
                <li>He was winning the drivers championship going into the second to last race of the season</li>
                <li>He drove into a gravel trap while entering the pit lane near the end of the race causing him to retire from the race. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn69iYew9wQ"target="_blank">Here is a video of the moment where he drove into the gravel trap:</a></li>
                <li>He ended up getting stuck in a gravel trap due to severe tire ware which his team boss later admitted was a strategy mistake not a driver error</li>
                <li>The gravel trap in question was removed the season later because it was completely useless and only caused harm</li>
                <li>Lewis Hamilton didn't blame anyone for the tyre descision even though he had the right to</li>
                
            </ol>
        </ul>
