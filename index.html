        <p>My name is Nathan Vaughn. I am a 14 year old boy who lives in Kirkland Washington. I like playing sports, watching sports, playing videogames, solving Rubik's cubes, and hanging out with my friends. My favorite sport to watch is basketball because it is also my favorite sport to play and I like the intensity of the game as well as the culture around the sport. I got into playing videogames when I got my first Xbox when I was 10. I started by playing Halo because my dad used to love playing it, NBA 2K, because I liked playing sports games and I liked basketball, Jedi Fallen Order, because it was a new game at the time and I had never played an RPG before, and Forza Horizon 4, because I liked cars and driving games. During covid, I started playing videogames online with my friends, and when I was 13, I built my first PC so I could take advantage of the wider catalogue of games. Now I play Valorant, Lies of P, BTD6, Jedi Survivor (the sequel to Jedi Fallen Order), and a few other games on and off. I learned how to solve a Rubik's cube when I was in 6th grade because one of my friends used to do it a lot and I thought that it would be fun to learn how. When I am with my friends, we usually play basketball or videogames together because that is something that we all enjoy doing. </p>
